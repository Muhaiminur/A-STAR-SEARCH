You are given a graph where the nodes denote cities and each edge denotes the distance of two connecting cities. Each node has a heuristic associated with it. The heuristic is the actual geological distance between a city and the destination city (Blue node). Now find the shortest path from the starting city (yellow node) to the destination city.


Input:
7 7 (Graph Dimension)  
s (Starting Location)  
f (Destination Location)  
s d 2  
s a 1.5  
a b 2  
b c 3  
c f 4  
e f 2  
d e 3  
s d 2  
s 10  
a 4  
b 2  
c 4  
e 2  
d 4.5  
f 0  
Output:  
1.	Shortest Path from source s to destination f.  
2.	Cost from source to destination.
